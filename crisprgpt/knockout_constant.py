Instruction:

Given the user input, identify the single most relevant Cas system below.

1. SpCas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes)
Pros:
High efficiency in a wide range of organisms.
Extensive research and documentation available.
Cons:
Large protein size can complicate delivery mechanisms.
Potential for off-target effects.
Applications:
Broad, including basic genetic research, gene therapy, and development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

2. enCas12a (engineered Cas12a variant)
Pros:
Smaller than SpCas9, allowing for easier delivery in certain vectors.
Generates staggered DNA double-strand breaks, potentially facilitating precise genome editing.
Has a lower off-target rate, offering increased genome editing fidelity.
Unique ability to simultaneously cut multiple sites, allowing for the efficient targeting and editing of several genomic locations in a single experiment.
Cons:
Sometimes exhibits lower editing efficiency compared to SpCas9.
Requires distinct PAM sequences, which might limit target sites.
Applications:
Ideal for applications requiring higher precision, reduced off-target and multiplexed editing, like therapeutic gene editing and complex genome engineering tasks.

3. SaCas9 (from Staphylococcus aureus)
Pros:
More compact than SpCas9, enhancing its suitability for certain delivery methods such as AAV vectors.
Cons:
Limited by a narrower PAM compatibility, restricting its targeting scope.
Applications:
Primarily used in in vivo therapeutic applications where delivery vector size is a limiting factor, such as gene therapy for inherited genetic disorders.

4. SpRYCas9 (engineered variant of SpCas9)
Pros:
Broadened PAM recognition, greatly expanding genomic targeting capabilities.
Cons:
Increased potential for off-target effects due to broader specificity.
Applications:
Suitable for complex genome editing applications targeting genomic regions previously inaccessible, including research and therapeutic contexts where high specificity is not as critical.

PROMPT_STEP1 = """
Step 1. Selecting a CRISPR/Cas system 

We support four types of CRISPR/Cas system for CRISPR knockout, SpCas9, enCas12a, SaCas9, and SpRYCas9, representing distinct variants with unique properties and applications.

1. SpCas9  (Jinek et al.,Science,2012;Cong et al.,Science,2013;Mali et al.,Science,2013;Jinek et al.,eLife,2013)
- Pros: Highly effective, well-studied, proven applications in many cell types/scenarios.  
- Cons: Large, potential off-target effects.  
- Uses: Genetic research, gene therapy, genetically modified models/organisms (GMMs/GMOs).

2. enCas12a  (Kleinstiver et al.,Nat Biotechnol.,2019;DeWeirdt et al.,Nat Biotechnol.,2020)
- Pros: Smaller, precise, low off-target rate, multi-target editing capability using a single guideRNA array.  
- Cons: May be less efficient than SpCas9 when using a single guideRNA (mitigated if using multi-guide array), limited target sites vs. SpCas9 due to more restrictive PAM.  
- Uses: High-precision and multiplexed genome editing (for genetic interaction, target redundant genes/pathways).

3. SaCas9  (Ran et al.,Nature,2015)
- Pros: Compact, suitable for AAV vectors (knockout genes in primary cells or in vivo).  
- Cons: limited target sites vs. SpCas9 due to more restrictive PAM.  
- Uses: In vivo gene therapy and some primary cells when using AAV delivery.

4. SpRYCas9  (Walton et al.,Science,2020)
- Pros: Wide PAM range, targets more genomic regions vs. typical SpCas9.  
- Cons: Higher off-target risks.  
- Uses: editing a specific target site where canonical PAMs for SpCas9/SaCas9/enCas12a are not available, and where specificity/off-target concerns are less critical.

🧬 Step 3. Designing guideRNA for gene knockout

Next, we would like to guide you through the design of guideRNA for your target gene. Designing an effective and specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA) is crucial for successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. There are several factors to consider in this process, including the selection of target sites that are unique to your gene of interest and minimizing potential off-target effects.
